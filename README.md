# Property Search

This is a simple Next.js/TypeScript application, inspired by [Property Cross project](http://propertycross.com/).

The project has two objectives:
* to test-drive a new framework before using it in production
* to present code samples for potential clients

**Live demo:** https://property-search-demo.vercel.app/
